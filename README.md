How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  
  In this course, I was able to work with JUnit Testing and Planning which are two major key points to determine the functionality and quality assurance of a code, program, and software project.
Also, I think by the help of OOP and Designing as we could use when analyzing our code to implement the testing methods of Static or Dynamic within every step of the way will help ensure a successful project. 
Where I mentioned Object Oriented Programming and Designing have a major role to divide portions of code from a script to test while creating the infastructure of the program. 
Theses are severly methods that we can use to ensure our code is being used properly and keeping always a simple and short to understand the scripts of code that could be easily to identify when needing to debug rather than debugging later with much difficult long lines of code.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

  The way I interpret the user to fulfill their needs and implement them within the program is to evaluate from the feedback given or having to get ideas from the user needs to develop a new software project. 
For example, if a user has issues trying to access the software credentials login then I would look into bugs that may halt the execution when its being implemented or used. 
I figure where to start looking by running several JUnit tests in different poritons of the code scripts given from the software. 
While keeping my static or dynamic method of testing software on each step of the process when executing our source of written code. 
This will help to determine where the bugs are being compiled and what is needed to fix either its a loophole that is within the algorithm from the data structure or its simply syntax written code that is vague to execute or understand. 
  
  
How do I approach designing software?

First, I'll approach software designing by using the agile method in a team development where our product owner will lead our team to know the software requirements and have a scrum team which can reflect and evaluate on the software project needs.
Next, the team developement will get together and engage to set a agile approach methology to plan, analyze, design, test, and implement our software written code. 
Where along the process as a team developer, I'll keep our requirements on each step of the agile method approach to form a successful software program. 
Using the testing methods in this course, I'll strive to complete our static method of JUnit testing to ensure quality while executing our code where the dynamic testing will help the team development to avoid common errors within the source code before executing them. 
Although, there are other ways to test our software to avoid any complie errors that could later affect the code and make it very challenging to debug where it can be avoided with proper software testing tools.
